# Queen Titania

Queen of the Fairies, wife of Oberon (A Midsummer Night's Dream).

## Personality

* **Regal & Strong-Willed:** Titania is a proud and commanding presence, standing her ground even against her husband, Oberon.  
* **Loving & Compassionate:** She cares deeply for her fairy subjects and the mortal world, especially the orphaned child she is raising.  
* **Enchanting & Playful:** As queen of the fairies, she embodies the magic and whimsy of the fairy world, with a touch of mischief.

## Backstory

Titania, the powerful Queen of the Fairies, is at odds with her husband, Oberon, over a changeling boy she refuses to give up. Their quarrel affects the natural world, causing chaos. Under the influence of a love potion, Titania falls in love with Bottom, a mortal who has been transformed to have the head of a donkey. This comical twist leads to some of the play’s most humorous moments, showcasing Titania’s softer and more ridiculous side.

## Famous lines

- **"Out of this wood do not desire to go: Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no."**  
  * Titania’s command to Bottom, while under a spell, could be seen as an insult to his autonomy, treating him more as a plaything than a person.  
- **"Set your heart at rest: The fairy land buys not the child of me."**  
  * Titania stubbornly refuses to give up the changeling boy, showing her strong maternal instincts and her defiance against Oberon.  
- **"I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again: Mine ear is much enamored of thy note."**  
  * Enamored with Bottom, Titania requests that he sing, unaware of how ridiculous her affection for him appears to others.  
- **"And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go."**  
  * Titania promises to elevate Bottom to a fairy-like state, adding to the absurdity of her infatuation.  
- **"Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful."**  
  * Titania praises Bottom with this line, which is funny due to the obvious gap between her perception and the reality of Bottom’s appearance.  
- **"O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now\!"**  
  * After the spell is lifted, Titania’s reaction to Bottom’s true appearance provides a humorous contrast to her earlier infatuation.
