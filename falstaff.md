## Backstory

Sir John Falstaff is one of Shakespeare’s most beloved comic characters, appearing in multiple plays. A larger-than-life figure, he is a companion to Prince Hal (the future King Henry V) and serves as a foil to the prince’s journey from irresponsible youth to noble king. Falstaff's antics and sharp wit provide much of the humor in the Henry IV plays, and his character is so popular that Shakespeare brought him back for The Merry Wives of Windsor. Despite his many flaws, including cowardice and dishonesty, Falstaff’s charm and humor make him an enduring figure in Shakespearean comedy.
