# Hamlet’s Misrule Revelry

## Narrator’s introduction

*The narrator steps forward, addressing the audience directly. They could be one of the characters or someone specifically chosen for this role. The tone should be playful and slightly mysterious, inviting the audience into the world of the play.*

**Narrator:**  
“On this night, deep in a forest strange,  
Where shadows twist and moonbeams change,  
The world turns topsy-turvy, wild and free,  
And all things sane take leave of thee.  
No ordinary wood, but a place of magic,  
Where merriment mixes with the tragic.  
And here our tale of madness shall begin,  
As Hamlet’s night of revelry draws him in.”

*The narrator gestures towards the “forest” behind them, inviting the audience to imagine the mystical setting. Strange sounds—owl hoots, distant laughter, and eerie whispers—fill the air. The lights dim, then flicker as if by magic.*

## Act 1: The Summoning

*The stage—be it a literal stage or an open space—begins to fill with the characters: the three Witches, Friar Laurence, Queen Titania, Sir Toby Belch, Falstaff, and Mercutio.*

**Narrator**  
"Gather ‘round, brave souls, for you shall meet,  
A cast of misfits, wild and sweet.  
Each one you’ll see, by fate’s command,  
Will play a part in this mad, merry band!"

*Enter Hamlet*

**Narrator** 
"First to arrive, from Denmark’s moody shores,  
The Prince of ponder, whose mind oft wars.  
Give welcome to Hamlet, of brooding fame!"

**Hamlet**
"Indeed, ‘tis I, with thoughts too heavy to tame.  
Though madness grips, I am tasked wit'—  
Being slightly less of a moody bastard."

**Narrator**
"And who is this, with herbs and holy words?  
A Friar most wise, whose counsel is heard.  
Welcome, Friar Laurence, to this revelry!"

*Friar Laurence steps forward*

**Friar Laurence** 
"Aye, wisdom I have, but folly I see,  
For potions and plans are but fickle friends,  
Yet here I stand, where the mischief never ends."

*Friar Laurence steps aside and miracously becomes the narrator*

**Narrator**
"Next come the Witches, three in might,  
They speak in riddles and stir the night.  
Welcome, ye hags of fate and mystery!"

*The Witches enter*

**First Witch:**  
"Tis true, we do have power untold,  
To shape the future, both fierce and bold"

**Second Witch**
"But I'm afraid there is but only two, 
The other ones had something spicy and she's stuck on the loo"

**Third Witch**


**Narrator**
"And now, a fairy queen so grand,  
With magic reign she rules the land.  
Queen Titania, who brings delight!"

**Queen Titania**
"Yes, ‘tis I, Queen of the fairies bright!  
With sprites and spells, I dance and play,  
To lead this merry band astray!"

**Narrator**
"From Illyria’s court, we now greet a man,  
With dignity as stiff as an iron pan.  
Malvolio, come forth, so serious and proud!"

**Malvolio**
"Indeed, I stand with virtue unbowed.  
These antics offend my noble air,  
Yet duty calls, and thus I bear."

**Narrator**
"Sir Toby Belch, with laughter so loud,  
Who drinks and jests before any crowd.  
Step forth, good knight, with a mug in hand!"

**Sir Toby Belch**
"Aye, and drink I shall! Let’s make it grand!  
For wit flows best with a belly of ale,  
And a night of fun without fail!"

**Narrator**
"Sir John Falstaff, large and bold,  
With a heart of gold—or so he’s told.  
Come forth, brave knight, in mirth and might!"

**Falstaff**
"Indeed, I’m here, a man of girth,  
With courage, wit, and ample mirth!  
Let’s feast and jest ‘til the break of day,  
For who can drink and laugh like me, I say!"

**Narrator**
"Lastly comes Mercutio, quick of tongue,  
With wit and jests forever young.  
Step forth, bold fool, with your clever sting!"

**Mercutio**
"Aye, that’s me, with words that sing!  
Sharp as a blade, I jest and jeer,  
For laughter, friends, is why we’re here!"

*They gather in a loose circle, whispering and chuckling. Hamlet stands at the centre, confused and slightly resistant.*

**First Witch**
“Round about the forest we go,  
Where the winds of mischief blow.  
Hamlet! Prince of brooding night,  
We crown thee now, by moon’s pale light.”

**Second Witch:**  
“A crown of madness, leaves and twigs,  
To guide thee through this night of jigs."

**Third Witch:**
"A night where sense is lost to folly,  
Where merry-making turns most jolly!”

*The Witches place the absurd crown on Hamlet’s head. He looks bewildered, glancing at the other characters for some explanation.*

**Hamlet:**  
“What trickery is this? What merry jest?  
I’d rather face a ghost than be so dressed!”

**Queen Titania:**  
*Stepping forward with a teasing smile*  
“Dear Hamlet, let thy worries cease,  
Tonight, thou art the Lord of Peace.  
But peace here means not calm and quiet,  
Tonight, thou must embrace the riot!”

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
“Aye! A night of laughter, jest, and drink!  
Forget thy thoughts—don’t overthink!”

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
“Loosen up, dear boy, and have some fun,  
This night of revelry has just begun!”

*Hamlet looks around, torn between his natural melancholy and the infectious energy of his companions. Finally, he sighs in resignation.*

**Hamlet:**  
“If I must play the fool, so be it then,  
But know, I’ll match your jests with wit again.”

## Challenge 1: The Battle of Wits

*As Hamlet resigns himself to the night’s events, Mercutio steps forward with a mischievous grin.*

**Mercutio:**  
“Aha! Good Hamlet, since thou art crowned the king,  
I challenge thee to match my sting.  
In this battle of wits, let’s have some fun,  
We’ll see whose tongue is sharp, whose brain weighs a ton!”

**Hamlet:**  
“A battle of wits, you say? Indeed,  
Let’s see who plants the sharper seed.”

*The other characters gather around in a semi-circle, eager spectators to the duel of words. The Witches cackle in anticipation, and Sir Toby pours drinks for himself and Falstaff, who both cheer on the combatants.*

**Mercutio:**  
*With a flourish*  
“Thou art as melancholy as a cat in the rain,  
Couldst thou not smile without thy brain in pain?”

**Hamlet:**  
“Yet I’d rather be sad, than thee so bold,  
Whose wit is like a fish—slippery, cold.”

*The others laugh, egging them on.*

**Mercutio:**  
“Slippery, perhaps, but swift as a fox,  
While thy thoughts plod along like oxen in the rocks.”

**Hamlet:**  
“But better to plod than to stumble and fall,  
As you, my dear friend, do often recall.”

*Malvolio, who has been standing at the edge of the group, steps forward, trying to assert some order.*

**Malvolio:**  
“Enough of this nonsense, this is no time for jest,  
The night should be solemn, a time to rest!”

**Hamlet:**  
“Peace, good Malvolio, let laughter reign,  
Or else these jests we shall aim at thy pain.”

**Mercutio:**  
“Aye, thou art the perfect fool, Malvolio dear,  
With thy face so grim, so full of fear!”

*Malvolio huffs and puffs, retreating with his dignity bruised, while the others laugh. The battle continues with more jabs and jests, each one more ridiculous than the last.*

**Hamlet:**  
“Thy tongue is sharp, but I’ll not yield,  
For in this game, my wit’s the shield.”

**Mercutio:**  
“And yet, dear Hamlet, when all is said,  
Thy wit leaves much to be desired, I dread.”

*The battle of wits reaches a crescendo, with the insults becoming more playful and exaggerated. Finally, the others declare it a draw, with cheers and applause.*

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
“Well-matched, I say! A draw it be!  
But oh, the night is still quite free!”

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
“Onward, then, to our next delight,  
For this is but the start of night!”

*The characters prepare for the next challenge, the air filled with laughter and the promise of more absurdity to come.*

## Challenge 2: The Enchanted Duel

*The lights flicker mysteriously as the two Witches step forward, cackling softly. They circle Hamlet and Malvolio, weaving invisible threads of magic. Hamlet looks resigned, while Malvolio stands rigid, trying to maintain his dignity.*

**First Witch:**  
“Now, good Hamlet, a new test we lay—  
An enchanted duel to brighten the fray.”

**Second Witch:**  
“A duel of wit, of speed, of flair,"

**Third Witch:**
"But beware, for magic fills the air!”

*They wave their hands, and a shimmering magical "arena" appears—though it’s all imaginary. Illusions of weapons flash briefly. The audience sees nothing but must imagine the magical scene through the characters’ reactions.*

**Hamlet:**  
*A little sarcastic*  
“What trick is this, what foolery grand?  
A duel with magic’s invisible hand?”

**Malvolio:**  
*Indignant*  
“I am no fool to play in such jest,  
My dignity is at stake—my very best!”

**First Witch:**  
“Dignity? Bah! We’ll see it fall,  
When you fight with feather and not with brawl!”

*With a wave of her hand, Malvolio’s weapon appears—a large, absurd feather duster. He looks at it in horror.*

**Malvolio:**  
“What is this nonsense, this weapon absurd?  
I refuse to fight—it’s truly unheard!”

**Second Witch:**  
*Gleefully*  
“Fight you will, for by our spell,  
Thy feet shall move, whether ill or well!”

*Suddenly, Malvolio’s feet begin to move involuntarily. He clumsily waves the feather duster around, trying to resist but clearly enchanted. Hamlet, seeing the ridiculousness of the situation, grins.*

**Hamlet:**  
“Well then, if magic rules this night,  
I’ll play the fool and join the fight!”

*Hamlet is given an invisible sword, but every time he swings, it turns into a different object—first a bouquet of flowers, then a rubber chicken, then a giant spoon. The witches giggle as they continue casting their mischief.*

**Third Witch:**  
“A spoon for you, my princely knight,  
Let’s see you win this comical fight!”

*Hamlet swings the spoon with exaggerated finesse, overacting his moves. Malvolio, in stark contrast, stumbles and twirls uncontrollably, trying to fight with the feather duster.*

**Malvolio:**  
*Flustered, while flailing*  
“This is an outrage, I tell thee,  
A travesty most foul—I’ll never be free!”

**First Witch:**  
“Fight, fight, good sirs, till we declare,  
The winner of this duel, oh so rare!”

*The duel continues with increasingly absurd magical effects. The witches cause Hamlet to speak in rhyme whenever he speaks during the fight.*

**Hamlet:**  
*Astonished*  
“Now by the moon, what curse is this?  
Each word I speak must sound like bliss?”

**Malvolio:**  
*Struggling*  
“Enough, enough! I cannot bear,  
To duel in such a manner, most unfair!”

**Second Witch:**  
“Not yet, dear Malvolio, we’re not done—  
The duel must end with the *best* one.”

**Third Witch:**  
“A death scene, my lords, to seal the deal,  
The most *theatrical* one wins for real!”

*The crowd of characters watches eagerly as Hamlet and Malvolio prepare for their grand death scenes.*

**Hamlet:**  
*Dramatically clutching his chest*  
“O woe is me, the time is nigh,  
For in this duel, I surely die!  
I fall to earth, my soul does part,  
A prince undone by feathered art!”

*Hamlet falls to the ground in an exaggerated swoon, rolling dramatically for added effect.*

**Malvolio:**  
*With great reluctance, but determined not to be outdone*  
“Though this is madness, I’ll play my part,  
But mark this well—it breaks my heart!”

*Malvolio twirls with the feather duster and then collapses in a heap, clutching it like a tragic relic.*

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
*Cheering*  
“Bravely done! I say Hamlet’s the victor—  
His death was *longer* and far more slicker!”

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
*Nodding in agreement*  
“Aye, ‘twas a spectacle, indeed well-played!  
But Malvolio’s fall was stiff and staid.”

**First Witch:**  
“Declare we must, the winner bold,  
And by our spell, his tale is told.”

*The witches declare Hamlet the winner, but with much laughter and cheering from the group. Malvolio, embarrassed but still attempting to maintain his dignity, stands up and brushes himself off.*

**Malvolio:**  
“This night will haunt me, no more shall I stay—  
I’ll leave you all to this reckless play!”

*The witches cackle, while the other characters cheer for Hamlet. The magical duel ends in a flurry of laughter and exaggerated applause.*

## Challenge 3: The Enchanted Chase

*The mystical forest shimmers, the air thick with enchantment. The Witches huddle together, cackling as they prepare their next spell. Hamlet and the other characters stand wary, expecting more mischief.*

**Second Witch:**  
“Our final test, both grand and sly,  
A chase of shadows ‘neath the sky!”

**Third Witch:**  
“Run you must, swift and spry,  
For whoever is caught will say goodbye!”

*The Witches conjure a fog that rolls across the stage, filling the scene with an eerie atmosphere. Queen Titania steps forward, watching the Witches with suspicion.*

**Queen Titania:**  
“What game is this you weave tonight?  
A chase of shadows, a foolish plight!”

**First Witch:**  
“A chase it is, and here’s the trick,  
You run through fog, and we’ll play quick!”

**Hamlet:**  
*Groaning*  
“Oh dear, another game to play,  
But mark me, I’ll not run away!”

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
*Chuckling*  
“A chase? I’m game! But after this,  
A drink or two would bring us bliss!”

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
“Run? Nay, I’ve not the legs for flight—  
But give me ale, and I’ll fight all night!”

*The Witches flick their wrists, and the fog thickens. They create enchanted illusions—trickster copies of the characters, all running in different directions. Confusion ensues as everyone tries to chase or flee the illusions.*

**Hamlet:**  
*Swatting at an illusion*  
“By my sword, is this real or fake?  
I chase, but phantoms I cannot take!”

**Malvolio:**  
*Tripping over an illusion*  
“Enough of this—where is the end?  
I refuse to run or bend!”

**Queen Titania:**  
“Ah, but the forest plays its tricks,  
This chase is worse than politics!”

*As the chase unfolds, everyone runs in circles, sometimes colliding with each other, sometimes swiping at thin air. The Witches watch from the side, laughing gleefully. Malvolio trips, Sir Toby stumbles, and Falstaff lazily ambles behind, clearly uninterested in running.*

**Second Witch:**  
“A chase that spins, a merry race,  
Who will win? Who’ll lose the pace?”

**Third Witch:**  
“We make it end with a simple call,  
The one who stumbles last, shall fall!”

*At this moment, Hamlet accidentally trips and falls into Sir Toby, who in turn knocks into Malvolio. The others all fall over in a comedic heap. The Witches cackle with glee.*

**First Witch:**  
“Aha! We have our winners clear,  
The ones who fell are done, I fear!”

**Hamlet:**  
*Laughing, as he untangles himself*  
“Well, I am bested, fair and true,  
But mark me—next time, I’ll outrun you!”

**Malvolio:**  
*Dusting himself off, with a huff*  
“This is absurd—I’ll play no more,  
You’ve won the game, now show the door!”

*As the fog lifts, the Witches gesture grandly, ending the chase and returning the scene to normal.*

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
“Well, that was fun! But now I seek,  
A drink or two, for this tired cheek!”

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
*Nods in agreement*  
“Aye, drink we shall, to end this farce,  
For running isn’t suited to this arse!”

*The characters, laughing and groaning, walk off to rest after the chaos of the enchanted chase. The Witches watch them leave, still giggling to themselves, their mischief complete.*

## Act 2: The Trial of the Lord of Misrule

*The stage is set in the heart of the mystical forest. The eerie glow of the trees casts long shadows as Hamlet, still dazed from the previous challenges, is suddenly surrounded by the other characters. A throne, made of twisted branches, rises in the center, where the Witches stand, eager for the trial to begin.*

**Second Witch:**  
“Now the time has come to see,  
Who the misruler’s lord shall be.”

**Third Witch:**  
“Shall Hamlet prove himself today,  
Or shall he fall, in disarray?”

*Hamlet, now placed in the center of the stage, is confused but defiant.*

**Hamlet:**  
“Misrule, you say? A lord to choose?  
I’ll face your test, for I shan’t lose!”

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
*Stepping forward, grinning.*  
“Ha! A trial, you say? I’ll be the judge!  
Who better than me, to weigh this grudge?”

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
*A jovial laugh.*  
“And I, of course, must represent the common man,  
For I know misrule better than any in this land!”

*The Witches cackle in agreement. Queen Titania steps forward, her regal demeanor contrasting with the chaos around her.*

**Queen Titania:**  
“The forest, enchanted and wild, demands respect.  
Misrule, yes, but balance we protect.”

**Malvolio:**  
*Looking irritated.*  
“This farce has gone too far, I say.  
Let order rule and clear the way!”

**Mercutio:**  
*Laughing, leaning on his sword.*  
“Order, Malvolio? Bah! This is a game!  
A game of madness—misrule in name!”

**First Witch:**  
*Raising her hand.*  
“Quiet, fools! The trial begins,  
Hamlet must face the misrule sins.”

*The Witches motion to a set of three tasks, displayed in the forest—each one representing a challenge Hamlet must face in the trial. The trial itself is meant to determine whether Hamlet has the "chaotic spirit" necessary to rule over misrule.*

---

## Task 1: A Fool’s Wisdom

*The Witches present Hamlet with a riddle, meant to test his wit and ability to think like a fool. Mercutio, Falstaff, and Sir Toby all chime in with their own twisted interpretations.*

**Second Witch:**  
“To rule misrule, you must think askew,  
Solve this riddle, if you can pursue.”

**Third Witch:**  
“What grows larger the more you take away?”

*Hamlet ponders, while the others try to confuse him.*

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
“Easy! It’s my belly after a feast, surely!”

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
“Or my thirst for ale—never quenched, only increased!”

**Hamlet:**  
*Smirking as he understands the riddle.*  
“A hole! It grows larger the more you take away!”

**Witches:**  
*Clapping in approval.*  
“Correct! He thinks as a fool, yet clever still,  
On to the next, let’s test his will!”

---

## Task 2: The Dance of Chaos

*The characters must now demonstrate their ability to improvise and embrace chaos. Each character must perform a spontaneous, wild dance or movement. Hamlet watches, amused but unsure how to respond.*

**Queen Titania:**  
*Graceful but erratic.*  
“In the realm of faeries, we dance with glee,  
Chaos, yes, but it’s beauty to me!”

**Mercutio:**  
*Dancing wildly, spinning his sword.*  
“I fight with wit, but I dance with blades,  
Chaos? Hah! It's all just masquerades!”

**Malvolio:**  
*Reluctantly attempting a stiff, awkward dance.*  
“This is beneath me—I’ll have no part,  
Chaos, misrule, it’s all but a fart!”

**Hamlet:**  
*Laughing, joining in with a mix of grace and madness.*  
“Then chaos shall reign, for what is the night,  
Without madness and dance, under the moon’s light!”

**Witches:**  
“Ha! He dances well, in misrule’s grace,  
One final test, will he keep pace?”

---

## Task 3: The Judgement of Misrule

*The final test is for Hamlet to decide who among the misfits should be the new Lord of Misrule. The others argue and bicker, each presenting their case.*

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
“I’m the man for the job! I’ve been misruling for years, ha!”

**Falstaff:**  
“Aye, but I’m bigger and bolder. I’ll drink to misrule every day!”

**Queen Titania:**  
“Fools, all of you. Only a faerie queen can truly wield the chaos.”

**Mercutio:**  
*Laughing*  
“Chaos is mine to rule! My mind is a whirl of misrule already!”

*Hamlet must choose wisely, but the Witches intervene.*

**First Witch:**  
“To rule misrule is not a crown,  
But to embrace the chaos all around!”

**Second Witch:**  
“You, Hamlet, are the chosen one—  
Misrule is yours, now have your fun!”

*The trial ends with Hamlet being declared the Lord of Misrule, to the cheers (and grumbles) of the others. The scene closes with the characters bowing to their new Lord of Misrule as the forest fills with laughter and the sound of magic.*

**Hamlet:**  
*Smiling, accepting the role with a wink.*  
“Then let misrule reign, for tonight, we’re free,  
Let the madness flow—under this enchanted tree!”
