# Hamlet’s Misrule Revelry

## Narrator’s introduction

*The narrator steps forward, addressing the audience directly. They could be one of the characters or someone specifically chosen for this role. The tone should be playful and slightly mysterious, inviting the audience into the world of the play.*

**Narrator:**  
“On this night, deep in a forest strange,  
Where shadows twist and moonbeams change,  
The world turns topsy-turvy, wild and free,  
And all things sane take leave of thee.  
No ordinary wood, but a place of magic,  
Where merriment mixes with the tragic.  
And here our tale of madness shall begin,  
As Hamlet’s night of revelry draws him in.”

*The narrator gestures towards the “forest” behind them, inviting the audience to imagine the mystical setting. Strange sounds—owl hoots, distant laughter, and eerie whispers—fill the air. The lights dim, then flicker as if by magic.*

## Act 1: The Summoning

*The stage—be it a literal stage or an open space—begins to fill with the characters: the three Witches, Friar Laurence, Queen Titania, Sir Toby Belch, Falstaff, and Mercutio.*

**Narrator**  
"Gather ‘round, brave souls, for you shall meet,  
A cast of misfits, wild and sweet.  
Each one you’ll see, by fate’s command,  
Will play a part in this mad, merry band!"

*Enter Hamlet*

**Narrator** 
"First to arrive, from Denmark’s moody shores,  
The Prince of ponder, whose mind oft wars.  
Give welcome to Hamlet, of brooding fame!"

**Hamlet**
"Indeed, ‘tis I, with thoughts too heavy to tame.  
Though madness grips, I am tasked wit'—  
Being slightly less of a moody bastard."

**Narrator**
"And who is this, with herbs and holy words?  
A Friar most wise, whose counsel is heard.  
Welcome, Friar Laurence, to this revelry!"

*Friar Laurence steps forward*

**Friar Laurence** 
"Aye, wisdom I have, but folly I see,  
For potions and plans are but fickle friends,  
Yet here I stand, where the mischief never ends."

*Friar Laurence steps aside and miracously becomes the narrator*

**Narrator**
"Next come the Witches, three in might,  
They speak in riddles and stir the night.  
Welcome, ye hags of fate and mystery!"

*The Witches enter*

**First Witch:**  
"Tis true, we three have power untold,  
To shape the future, both fierce and bold"

**Second Witch**
"But I'm afraid there is but only two, 
The other ones had something spicy and she's stuck on the loo"

**Narrator**
"And now, a fairy queen so grand,  
With magic reign she rules the land.  
Queen Titania, who brings delight!"

**Queen Titania**
"Yes, ‘tis I, Queen of the fairies bright!  
With sprites and spells, I dance and play,  
To lead this merry band astray!"

**Narrator**
"From Illyria’s court, we now greet a man,  
With dignity as stiff as an iron pan.  
Malvolio, come forth, so serious and proud!"

**Malvolio**
"Indeed, I stand with virtue unbowed.  
These antics offend my noble air,  
Yet duty calls, and thus I bear."

**Narrator**
"Sir Toby Belch, with laughter so loud,  
Who drinks and jests before any crowd.  
Step forth, good knight, with a mug in hand!"

**Sir Toby Belch**
"Aye, and drink I shall! Let’s make it grand!  
For wit flows best with a belly of ale,  
And a night of fun without fail!"

**Narrator**
"Sir John Falstaff, large and bold,  
With a heart of gold—or so he’s told.  
Come forth, brave knight, in mirth and might!"

**Falstaff**
"Indeed, I’m here, a man of girth,  
With courage, wit, and ample mirth!  
Let’s feast and jest ‘til the break of day,  
For who can drink and laugh like me, I say!"

**Narrator**
"Lastly comes Mercutio, quick of tongue,  
With wit and jests forever young.  
Step forth, bold fool, with your clever sting!"

**Mercutio**
"Aye, that’s me, with words that sing!  
Sharp as a blade, I jest and jeer,  
For laughter, friends, is why we’re here!"

*They gather in a loose circle, whispering and chuckling. Hamlet stands at the centre, confused and slightly resistant.*

**First Witch**
“Round about the forest we go,  
Where the winds of mischief blow.  
Hamlet! Prince of brooding night,  
We crown thee now, by moon’s pale light.”

**Second Witch:**  
“A crown of madness, leaves and twigs,  
To guide thee through this night of jigs.”

**Third Witch:**  
“A night where sense is lost to folly,  
Where merry-making turns most jolly!”

*The Witches place the absurd crown on Hamlet’s head. He looks bewildered, glancing at the other characters for some explanation.*

**Hamlet:**  
“What trickery is this? What merry jest?  
I’d rather face a ghost than be so dressed!”

**Queen Titania:**  
*Stepping forward with a teasing smile*  
“Dear Hamlet, let thy worries cease,  
Tonight, thou art the Lord of Peace.  
But peace here means not calm and quiet,  
Tonight, thou must embrace the riot!”

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
“Aye! A night of laughter, jest, and drink!  
Forget thy thoughts—don’t overthink!”

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
“Loosen up, dear boy, and have some fun,  
This night of revelry has just begun!”

*Hamlet looks around, torn between his natural melancholy and the infectious energy of his companions. Finally, he sighs in resignation.*

**Hamlet:**  
“If I must play the fool, so be it then,  
But know, I’ll match your jests with wit again.”

## Challenge 1: The Battle of Wits

*As Hamlet resigns himself to the night’s events, Mercutio steps forward with a mischievous grin.*

**Mercutio:**  
“Aha! Good Hamlet, since thou art crowned the king,  
I challenge thee to match my sting.  
In this battle of wits, let’s have some fun,  
We’ll see whose tongue is sharp, whose brain weighs a ton!”

**Hamlet:**  
“A battle of wits, you say? Indeed,  
Let’s see who plants the sharper seed.”

*The other characters gather around in a semi-circle, eager spectators to the duel of words. The Witches cackle in anticipation, and Sir Toby pours drinks for himself and Falstaff, who both cheer on the combatants.*

**Mercutio:**  
*With a flourish*  
“Thou art as melancholy as a cat in the rain,  
Couldst thou not smile without thy brain in pain?”

**Hamlet:**  
“Yet I’d rather be sad, than thee so bold,  
Whose wit is like a fish—slippery, cold.”

*The others laugh, egging them on.*

**Mercutio:**  
“Slippery, perhaps, but swift as a fox,  
While thy thoughts plod along like oxen in the rocks.”

**Hamlet:**  
“But better to plod than to stumble and fall,  
As you, my dear friend, do often recall.”

*Malvolio, who has been standing at the edge of the group, steps forward, trying to assert some order.*

**Malvolio:**  
“Enough of this nonsense, this is no time for jest,  
The night should be solemn, a time to rest!”

**Hamlet:**  
“Peace, good Malvolio, let laughter reign,  
Or else these jests we shall aim at thy pain.”

**Mercutio:**  
“Aye, thou art the perfect fool, Malvolio dear,  
With thy face so grim, so full of fear!”

*Malvolio huffs and puffs, retreating with his dignity bruised, while the others laugh. The battle continues with more jabs and jests, each one more ridiculous than the last.*

**Hamlet:**  
“Thy tongue is sharp, but I’ll not yield,  
For in this game, my wit’s the shield.”

**Mercutio:**  
“And yet, dear Hamlet, when all is said,  
Thy wit leaves much to be desired, I dread.”

*The battle of wits reaches a crescendo, with the insults becoming more playful and exaggerated. Finally, the others declare it a draw, with cheers and applause.*

**Sir John Falstaff:**  
“Well-matched, I say! A draw it be!  
But oh, the night is still quite free!”

**Sir Toby Belch:**  
“Onward, then, to our next delight,  
For this is but the start of night!”

*The characters prepare for the next challenge, the air filled with laughter and the promise of more absurdity to come.*
