# Malvolio

Steward to Lady Olivia, known for his self-righteousness and ambition (Twelfth Night).

## Personality

* **Pompous & Self-Righteous:** Malvolio is serious, puritanical, and often acts as though he’s above others, making him a target for mockery.  
* **Ambitious & Gullible:** He harbors dreams of rising in social status, which makes him easy prey for tricks and schemes.  
* **Unintentionally Humorous:** His stern demeanor and inflated ego lead to comedic situations, especially when he’s tricked into believing Lady Olivia loves him.

## Backstory

Malvolio is the straight-laced steward in Olivia’s household, devoted to maintaining order and decorum. However, his self-importance and aspirations of social climbing make him the perfect victim for the mischievous schemes of other characters. When tricked into believing that Olivia loves him, he makes a fool of himself, which leads to one of the play’s most famous comedic subplots.

## Famous lines

- **"Go, hang yourselves all\! You are idle, shallow things: I am not of your element."**  
  * Malvolio’s disdainful dismissal of the other characters, whom he considers beneath him, is one of his most memorable and cutting lines.  
- **"My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?"**  
  * Malvolio criticizes Sir Toby and his companions for their late-night revelry, insulting their intelligence, manners, and integrity.  
- **"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."**  
  * This line is from the forged letter that Malvolio finds, leading him to believe Olivia loves him. His grand recitation of it is comically absurd.  
- **"I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered."**  
  * Malvolio, completely falling for the prank, decides to follow the letter’s bizarre instructions, leading to his ridiculous appearance in yellow stockings.  
- **"I thank my stars, I am happy."**  
  * Malvolio’s overconfidence, just before everything goes wrong, highlights his delusion and sets the stage for his eventual downfall.  
- **"Why, this is very midsummer madness."**  
  * Malvolio’s reaction to what he perceives as Olivia’s irrational behavior is ironic, considering his own descent into foolishness.  
- **"I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you\!"**  
  * Malvolio’s final, bitter outburst as he exits, humiliated and furious, is both funny and somewhat tragic.

## Great Shakespearean insults

* **“Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat.”**  
* **“Methink’st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee.”**  
* **“Thou crusty batch of nature\!”**
