# Mercutio

Romeo’s close friend, a witty and imaginative nobleman.

## Personality

* **Brash & Bold:** Unafraid to speak his mind, Mercutio frequently provokes others with his sharp tongue and bold demeanor.  
* **Loyal & Passionate:** His deep loyalty to Romeo and disdain for the feud between the Montagues and Capulets ultimately lead to his tragic demise.

## **Backstory** 

Mercutio, a relative of Prince Escalus and a close friend of Romeo, serves as a foil to the romantic Romeo with his pragmatic and often cynical views on love and life. Known for his "Queen Mab" speech and his biting humor, Mercutio’s lively presence contrasts the darker themes of the play. His provocative nature leads him into a fatal duel with Tybalt, which becomes a catalyst for the tragic events that follow.
