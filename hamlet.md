# Hamlet

The Prince of Denmark, son of the late King Hamlet and Queen Gertrude.

## Personality

* **Contemplative & Philosophical:** Hamlet is famous for his deep introspection and existential musings. He’s always pondering the nature of life, death, and his own purpose.  
* **Melancholic & Brooding:** Hamlet often feels overwhelmed by grief, betrayal, and anger, particularly after his father's death and his mother’s quick remarriage to Claudius.  
* **Cunning & Witty:** Despite his serious demeanor, Hamlet is sharp-tongued and skilled in wordplay. He uses his wit to expose the corruption around him.  
* **Indecisive & Conflicted:** Hamlet struggles with taking decisive action, torn between avenging his father and his moral scruples.

## Backstory

Hamlet’s life is turned upside down when his father, King Hamlet, dies mysteriously. His mother, Queen Gertrude, quickly remarries Hamlet’s uncle, Claudius, who seizes the throne. Haunted by his father's ghost, who reveals that Claudius is the murderer, Hamlet is driven to seek revenge, yet he wrestles with the moral implications of his actions. His quest for vengeance leads to a series of tragic events.
